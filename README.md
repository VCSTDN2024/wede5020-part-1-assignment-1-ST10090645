2. Overview and Timeline
---

This website for "For The Table" (a fictional retail store) is currently being developed for this subject’s PoE. It is being developed in Visual Studio Code and this README serves to document the development process as well as a majority of the design choices.

Currently, as per the requirements for Part 2 of the PoE, the website has a solid HTML foundation and an extensive .CSS file that provides elaborate styling, interactivity and responsive design to the website. Functionality that will be achieved through the use of JS code, will come at a later stage.

---
3. Objectives
---

The objective of this website is for it to serve as a fully-functional and professional site that the owners "For The Table" can host, in order to increase sales and boost public interest. Their desire is for the website to function as a “one-stop shop” of sorts, in the sense that they want to be the hub that most users default to when it comes to any TCG/Tabletop game related matter, whether that be purchasing items or memorabilia, seeking to gain knowledge and information on how a variety of the games on offer are played, or even seeking to join particular communities with similar interests and networking opportunities through events that may be hosted at their stores. 

This website's purpose is to assist them in this matter.

---
4. Key Features
---

Some key features that this website hopes to develop include:

- An attractive home page with eye-catching material and various navigation links
- A "Shop" page that will allow users to add items to their cart and receive a quotation, email for when their order will be ready for pickup.
- Intuitive, seamless and easy-to-use navigation throughout the website.
- Consistent themes, colours and CSS styling throughout the website.
- Responsive design that ensures viability for all screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile).
- A "Contact" page that contains all relevant information as well as a form to contact the staff directly.
