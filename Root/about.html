            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>Our business started off as two passionate tabletop gamers, who, after the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, 
            sought to revitalize the tabletop gaming hobby by making it more accessible and easy to get into than ever. 
                Thus, For the Table was born, a small, niche shop in a quiet corner of Sandton, has now grown at a modest pace and now has two locations across the country, 
                as well as a new website/online store (that's where you are right now!).</p>

            <h1>Our Goal</h1>
            <p>Our hope and goal is to not only be a reliable supplier but also foster a life-changing hobby in many others that brings people together and helps create epic memories. 
            Look forward to exciting in-person events, as well as some digital online events for those who are a little shy, where you'll hopefully find new friends and new games to add to your game nights!</p>
